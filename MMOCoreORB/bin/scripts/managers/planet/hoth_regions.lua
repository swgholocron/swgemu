-- Hoth regions, ported from SWG Infinity.
--
-- Kept: the full-planet no-build zone, the Scavenger Starport city region, navigation areas and no-spawn zones.
--
-- Enabled: the world spawner, using the hoth_world group (ported from Flurry into
-- custom_scripts/mobile/flurry_planets/spawn).
--
-- Still disabled (commented out below): the northwest elite and northeast hard areas. They reference spawn
-- groups (hoth_northwest_elite, hoth_northeast_hard) that are not defined on this server, and
-- SpawnAreaImplementation::buildSpawnList does not null-check a missing group, so enabling them without the
-- groups would crash the server. Define the groups first, then uncomment the matching entries.
--
-- Planet Region Definitions
--
-- {"regionName", x, y, shape and size, tier, {"spawnGroup1", ...}, maxSpawnLimit}
-- For circle and ring, x and y are the center point
-- For rectangles, x and y are the bottom left corner. x2 and y2 (see below) are the upper right corner
-- Shape and size is a table with the following format depending on the shape of the area:
--   - Circle: {CIRCLE, radius}
--   - Rectangle: {RECTANGLE, x2, y2}
--   - Ring: {RING, inner radius, outer radius}
-- Tier is a bit mask with the following possible values where each hexadecimal position is one possible configuration.
-- That means that it is not possible to have both a spawn area and a no spawn area in the same region, but
-- a spawn area that is also a no build zone is possible.
